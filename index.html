        <h3 id="headline">The chronology of his life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1921</strong> - Born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR</li>
          <li><strong>1931</strong> - Moves with his family back to Tehran, Iran</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Graduates from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering, one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by World War II</li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - Decides to leave for the United States to continue his education</li>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - Arrives in mid-1944, lived in New York and worked for an electronic association, and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a graduate student in September that year</li>
          <li><strong>1946</strong> - Receives an MS degree in electrical engineering from MIT</li>
          <li><strong>1947</strong> - Goes to work as an engineer at Columbia University</li>
          <li><strong>1949</strong> - Receives his PhD in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949 and becomes an assistant professor the next year</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Is credited, along with John R. Ragazzini, with having pioneered the development of the Z-transform method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in digital signal processing, digital control, and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research</li>
          <li><strong>1957</strong> - Promotes to full professor</li>
          <li><strong>1959</strong> - Joins the Electrical Engineering faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. During his lengthy research career, Zadeh makes important scientific contributions in two distinct areas: (1) linear system theory and classical control systems, and (2) fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and related science and technology.</li>
          <li><strong>1963</strong> - Becomes the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley</li>
          <li><strong>1965</strong> - Publishes his seminal work on fuzzy sets, in which he described the motivation of replicating human-like reasoning and detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory</li>
          <li><strong>1967</strong> - Is awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Natural Sciences in Applied Mathematics</li>
          <li><strong>1968</strong> - Completes the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley's advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research, but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments</li>
          <li><strong>1973</strong> - Receives the prestigious (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) IEEE Education Award, largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS</li>
          <li><strong>1973</strong> - Proposes his theory of fuzzy logic. Together, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic provide the necessary foundations for a broad class of related innovations, including (but not limited to):
            <ul>
              <li>fuzzy control – a practical approach to non-linear control using fuzzy if-then rules in fuzzy logic</li>
              <li>fuzzy pattern recognition – a generalization of conventional pattern recognition techniques using fuzzy sets (e.g., fuzzy k-means generalizes k-means clustering)</li>
              <li>fuzzy database – generalizes classical database query language using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic</li>
              <li>fuzzy mathematics – generalizes conventional mathematics using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic</li>
              <li>neuro-fuzzy systems – a synergistic combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks, providing the first interpretable AI system based on neural network learning</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>1976</strong> - Receives Eringen Medal</li>
          <li><strong>1992</strong> - IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal, for "seminal contributions to information science and systems, including the conceptualization of fuzzy sets"</li>
          <li><strong>1993</strong> - Receives American Society of Mechanical Engineers Rufus Oldenburger Medal</li>
          <li><strong>1993</strong> - Receives Honorary Professorship from the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy</li>
          <li><strong>1995</strong> - Receives IEEE Medal of Honor, for "pioneering development of fuzzy logic and its many diverse applications"</li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> - Receives American Automatic Control Council's Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award</li>
          <li><strong>2001</strong> - Receives ACM Allen Newell Award</li>
          <li><strong>2003</strong> - Receives Outstanding Contribution Award, Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC), Halifax, Canada</li>
          <li><strong>2004</strong> - His name is included at Wall of Fame, Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF), Paderborn, Germany</li>
          <li><strong>2004</strong> - Receives V. Kaufmann Prize and Gold Medal, International Association for Fuzzy-Set Management and Economy (SIGEF), Barcelona, Spain</li>
          <li><strong>2005</strong> - Receives J. Keith Brimacombe IPMM Award in recognition of his development of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - Receives Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, for inventing and developing the field of "fuzzy logic"</li>
          <li><strong>2011</strong> - Is inducted into the IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame, "for his work on soft computing, fuzzy logic, and neural-net theory"</li>
          <li><strong>2011</strong> - Receives Honorary Doctor of the Óbuda University (Budapest, Hungary)</li>
          <li><strong>2012</strong> - Receives BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Spain</li>
          <li><strong>2017</strong> - Receives Golden Goose Award, for Fuzzy Logic</li>
          <li><strong>2017</strong> - Sies in his home in Berkeley, California, on 6 September, at the age of 96. He was buried at the First Alley of Honors, on 29 September in Baku, Azerbaijan, the city in which he was born.</li>

          <p>But a blunt question remains: Is professor Zadeh presenting important ideas or is he indulging in wishful thinking? No doubt Professor Zadeh's enthusiasm for fuzziness has been reinforced by the prevailing climate in the U.S.-one of unprecedented permissiveness. 'Fuzzification, is a kind of scientific permissiveness; it tends to result in socially appealing slogans unaccompanied by the discipline of hard scientific work and patient observation.</p>
